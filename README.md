# Hi there! 
This is my shot at making a simple website for a university course about computer networking! My aim was to make it look like an "oldschool" website that is funny and playful at the same time. It does not necessiraly feel like one, because I tried to make it at least responsive.

I had a list of requirements that I had to include in the website such as multinested lists, images, (could not use folders as well, that's why it is messy), etc.

I was inspired by a website with a similar nature that was actually from that old era of websites. Unfortunately, I no longer have the link available, though I remember it was reachable only via the wayback machine.
